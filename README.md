## What is this and who is it for ‚≠ê

This is a simplified Todoist clone built with React and Firebase.
I've build it to practice my newly aquired React skills after finishing the great [Learn React for free](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) course on Scrimba.com.

It's a more _complex_ coding project than I've previously attempted, as I wanted to...

...practice React under more _real world_ conditions to find and push my limits.
...experience some of the pain points and needs of a growing code base (e.g. organizing files, automated testing, ...).
...go from zero to a fully deployed web app for the first time.

This project might be interesting for anyone looking for a React project to practice their coding skills after finishing an introductory / intermediate React online course. I hope it helps you to become a better programmer, too ü§ì.

- Simple local React state management, without redux, recoil, mobx, or similar

- This project was originally inspired by Karl Hadwen's YouTube tutorial [Building Todoist From Scratch](https://youtu.be/HgfA4W_VjmI). However, I decided to build it more or less from scratch after watching the first few hours of the video.
- Code organization heavily inspired by Ivor Reic inspiring [Jira Clone](https://github.com/oldboyxx/jira_clone/tree/190dfcd9dc62189a2852acf8e9e7869178a8008c) repo. // TODO: to be implemented.
- To my awesome code tutor Esen for encouragement and super valuable code feedback.
