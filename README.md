## What is this and who is it for ⭐

This is a simplified Todoist clone built with React and Firebase.
I've build it to practice my newly aquired React skills after finishing the great [Learn React for free](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) course on Scrimba.com.

It's a more _complex_ coding project than I've previously attempted, as I wanted to:

- Practice React under more _real world_ conditions to find and push my limits.
- Experience some of the pain points and needs of a growing code base (e.g. organizing files, automated testing, ...).
- Go from zero to a fully deployed web app for the first time.

This project might be interesting for anyone looking for a React project to practice their coding skills after finishing an introductory / intermediate React online course. I hope it helps you to become a better programmer, too 🤓.

## Features

- Simple local React state management, without redux, recoil, mobx, or similar
- Todoist UI (as of January 2022)
