## What is this and who is it for ⭐

This is a simplified Todoist clone built with React and Firebase.
I've built it to practice React after finishing an online [introductory course on React on Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact).

It's a more _complex_ coding project than anything I've attempted previously, as I wanted to:

- Practice React under more _real-world_ conditions to find and push my limits.
- Experience some of the pain points and needs of a growing codebase (e.g. managing state, organizing files, automated testing, ...).
- Go from zero to a fully deployed web app for the first time.

This project might be interesting for anyone learning React, who's looking for a practice project that's...

- ... challenging, but not overwhelming.
- ... using 'pure' React and vanilla JS (no Redux, jQuery, Typescript, ... ).
- ... frontend focused (backend implemented via Firebase / Firestore).

I hope it helps you to become a better React programmer, too 🤓.
